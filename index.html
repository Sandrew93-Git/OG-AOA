        <p>Stay up to date on our Youtube content! Join us as we navigate small streams for everything from 6 inch brook trout, to 35 lb. Chinook Salmon and many other locals. Our goal is to keep each video under 10 minutes long in order to give you the information you need about the area we are fishing, the species we are targeting, and what techniques and gear we are using to get the job done, all in a timely fashion. And at the same time, leave you with wanting more so that you will be heading out there and trying it all yourself. Don't forget to hit like for us and subscribe to our channel for more helpful tips and techniques or just to get your fishing fix in for the day. </p>
